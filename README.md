Sequoia Grove
==
Weekly Employee Scheduling Application

Sequoia Grove is a web application designed to simplify employee scheduling. 
It was designed for businesses following a scheduling system where work schedules 
with shifts are written and published weekly. The model for this product was 
constructed by researching the current system in place by a  local Delicatessen, 
[The Sequoia Sandwich Company](http://www.sequoiasandwich.com/v4/). 
The application then expands on the model by being built generically enough 
to accommodate any business operating on a similar basis.
Project satisfies senior project requirement for bachelor's degree of computer 
science at California State University, Bakersfield (CSUB)
