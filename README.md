  * print categorized checklists: total order construction, sandwiches only, bakery only, customer pickup or delivery schedule
* Supervisor Information Manual: maintain updated information including: important phone numbers, list of store accounts, what to do in given situations (example: hot water not working usually means restart pilot light), bulletin notes, 
* Request Switching Shifts, or giving shifts (giving and taking?)
